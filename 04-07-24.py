Duplicate Subtrees

Given a binary tree, your task is to find all duplicate subtrees from the given binary tree.

Note:  Return the root of each tree in the form of a list array & the driver code will print the tree in pre-order tree traversal in lexicographically increasing order.

Examples:

Input :

Output: 2 4
        4
Explanation: The above tree have two duplicate subtrees.i.e
  2
 /
4  and 4. Therefore, you need to return the above tree root in the form of a list.
Input:     5
          / \
         4   6
        / \
       3   4
          / \
         3   6
Output: 4 3
        6
Explanation: In the above tree, there are two duplicate subtrees.i.e
  4
 /
3   and 6. Therefore, you need to return the above subtrees root in the form of a list.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Space Complexity: O(n)

Constraints:
1<= size of binary tree <=100
